# Search Relevance Algorithm with SBERT  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
Search relevance measures how effectively search results align with user intent, playing a critical role in industries like e-commerce, content platforms, and news outlets. This project demonstrates an efficient solution for enhancing search relevance by leveraging **Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** for semantic embeddings and the **ANNOY** library for fast approximate nearest neighbor search.  

Deployed on AWS with **Docker** and a **Flask API**, the solution provides an intuitive interface for querying and retrieving relevant news articles.

## üèÜ Aim  
To improve the search experience for news articles using:  
1. **SBERT** for semantically meaningful embeddings.  
2. **ANNOY** for efficient similarity-based search.  
3. **AWS** for scalable deployment.

## üìä Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of 22,399 articles with the following attributes:  
- **article_id**: Unique identifier for each article.  
- **category/subcategory**: Classification for topic granularity.  
- **title**: Article headline.  
- **published_date**: Publication date.  
- **text**: Full article body.  
- **source**: Originating source or publication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `spacy`, `sentence-transformers`, `annoy`, `flask`, `AWS`  
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS EC2

## üìù Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization.  

2. **SBERT Training**:  
   - Generate semantically meaningful embeddings for articles.  

3. **ANNOY Indexing**:  
   - Create a fast, efficient approximate nearest neighbor index.  

4. **Deployment**:  
   - Containerized components (Flask API, SBERT model, ANNOY index) deployed on AWS using Docker.
